   <h2>
    <em>Maddy Kelly</em> is a singer-songwriter and industry professional based in New Orleans, Louisiana. Raised in rural New Jersey, she was classically trained in voice from a young age, and grew up listening to the music of CSNY, Joni Mitchell, Janis Joplin, and the Foo Fighters.  She is trained in piano performance and a self taught guitarist, taking her songwriting seriously during quarantine. With an interest in artist and tour management as well as performing, her ultimate goal is to become a multi faceted musician.
